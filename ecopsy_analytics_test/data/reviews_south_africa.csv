"695";"South Africa";"This is a well-balanced, well-structured white wine that's sure to evolve through 2020, at least. It's certainly attractive now, with subtle toasty notes of sweet spice and wood-grilled apple alongside hints of kiwi, sweet grass, green plum and lime. The medium-weight palate offers ample acidity and a streak of minerality that keeps things fresh and lifted through the softly spiced finish.";"Reserve";"91";"50";"Stellenbosch";NA;"Lаurеn Buzzео";"Reyneke 2013 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Stellenbosch)";"Sauvignon Blanc";"Reyneke"
"658";"South Africa";"The 2011 Night Sky shows more earthy character than the 2012, as upfront aromas of soil, blackberry leaf and pepper are grounded by ripe fruit tones of black currant, plum and mulberry. Medium weight on the palate, with velvety tannins that grip through the long, spicy finish. The dense, tight mouthfeel, firm structure and overall balance suggest this wine will age well through 2022.";"Night Sky";"92";"50";"Coastal Region";NA;"Laurеn Buzzеo";"Fable Mountain 2011 Night Sky Red (Coastal Region)";"Rhône-style Red Blend";"Fable Mountain"

"258";"South Africa";"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced.";"The William";"89";"18";"Coastal Region";NA;"Lauren Buzzeo";"Graham Beck 2007 The William Red (Coastal Region)";"Red Blend";"Graham Beck"
