"110540";"Lebanon";"Smoky and rich with a swirl of petrol, dried apple and smoked nut skin flavors on the nose and palate, this is a dry, full-bodied white blend that's intentionally savory in style.

"99053";"Lebanon";"Light straw to the eye, this blend of 40% Muscat, 30% Viognier, 15% Sémillon and 15% Sauvignon Blanc smells of grapefruit, lemon pith and grass after a rain shower.

"39144";"Lebanon";"The Jeune Red from Château Musar's second line (formerly labeled Musar Cuvée Rouge) is a blend of Cinsault, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon that smells sweetly of ripe black cherries with rustic herbal and earthy notes. It opens softly with sweet blackberries and a hint of green bramble, but is chased by a mid-palate of fairly aggressive tannins and acidity. Fermented and aged in concrete vats, the Musar Jeune is completely unoaked and intended for early consumption, but would probably do nicely with some bottle aging as well.";"Jeune Red";"87";"20";"Bekaa Valley";NA;"Anna Lее C.
