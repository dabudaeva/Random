"119288";"Canada";"This young wine is still pulling itself together. A small percentage was barrel-fermented, but what dominates are crisp fruit flavors of lime and apple.

"7745";"Canada";"Essentially a Bordeaux-style blend (just 4% Syrah breaks the mold), this smooth, silky wine is seductive. The blueberry, black cherry and plum fruit has compelling complexity, further enhanced with flavors of coffee and toast from 14 months in French oak.";"LFNG Blind Trust";"92";"30";"British Columbia";"Okanagan Valley";"Paul Grеgutt";"Laughing Stock 2011 LFNG Blind Trust Red (Okanagan Valley)";"Bordeaux-style Red Blend";"Laughing Stock"
"7592";"Canada";"This is quite light, with berry fruit running into tongue-scraping tannins. Flavors of earth and stem add still more grip and herbaceous character, outstripping the mild fruit.";"Rock Pocket Vineyard";"87";"28";"British Columbia";"Okanagan Valley";"Paul Gregutt";"Township 7 2014 Rock Pocket Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Okanagan Valley)";"Cabernet Franc";"Township 7"
"7588";"Canada";"This off-dry wine is solid, with a mix of lemons and oranges in a broad, fruity midpalate. A thick streak of sweet tea comes up also, and the wine, though blocky and one-dimensional, is quite nice chilled down as an apéritif.";"Sweet";"87";"16";"Ontario";"Lake Erie North Shore";"Paul Grеgutt";"North 42 Degrees 2016 Sweet Riesling (Lake Erie North Shore)";"Riesling";"North 42 Degrees"
"7484";"Canada";"Produced from the estate vineyard's oldest vines, this CSV bottling is a dry, leesy, textural wine, with dominant flavors of citrus flesh and rind along with green apples. There's a strong streak of mineral also, and a well-balanced finish of medium length.";"CSV Estate Bottled";"92";"25";"Ontario";"Beamsville Bench";"Paul Grеgutt";"Cave Spring 2012 CSV Estate Bottled Riesling (Beamsville Bench)";"Riesling";"Cave Spring"

"7475";"Canada";"This irresistible, lightly frizzante and utterly refreshing wine is a gem. Orange flesh and rind has a slightly candied potency, with outstanding purity, focus and length. In spite of the sweetness, it retains offsetting minerality and acidity, making it a perfect apéritif or brunch wine.";"Moscato d'Osoyoos";"92";"20";"British Columbia";"Okanagan Valley";"Pаul Grеgutt";"LaStella 2013 Moscato d'Osoyoos Moscato (Okanagan Valley)";"Moscato";"LaStella"
"7113";"Canada";"From the Canadian Okanagan, this stylish, well-balanced wine offers a focused mix of flavors—cola, cherry, tobacco and wet stone in particular.

"7097";"Canada";"This wine plays out broadly across the palate, showing tart berries and espresso components, along with a whiff of asparagus. The fruit is somewhat thin and front-loaded, with barrel flavors of toast and cigar box masking some—not all—of the herbaceousness.";NA;"87";"49";"British Columbia";"Okanagan Valley";"Paul Gregutt";"Burrowing Owl 2011 Meritage (Okanagan Valley)";"Meritage";"Burrowing Owl"
"6835";"Canada";"Cab Franc makes a strong case for being top gun among this region's reds. This estate-grown example has been vinified for aromatics, elegance, balance and detail, and succeeds beautifully. Juicy boysenberry and blueberry fruit is buoyed with ample acidity. The flavors penetrate through a clean, crisp, lingering finish. Just 60 cases were exported to the U.S.";NA;"89";"20";"Ontario";"Niagara Escarpment";"Paul Gregutt";"Cave Spring 2014 Cabernet Franc (Niagara Escarpment)";"Cabernet Franc";"Cave Spring"

"5635";"Canada";"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off). Grassy hints of fresh asparagus remain, and with peppery herb, juicy gooseberry and citrus peel.";"Blue Terrace Vineyard Reserve";"90";"23";"British Columbia";"Okanagan Valley";"Paul Gregutt";"Township 7 2015 Blue Terrace Vineyard Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Okanagan Valley)";"Sauvignon Blanc";"Township 7"
